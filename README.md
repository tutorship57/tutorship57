<h1 align="left">Hi 👋, My name is Anuwat Thannop</h1>

I’m a third-year university student and a motivated full-stack developer.<br/>
I love solving problems, learning by building, and improving through feedback.<br/>
My interests include Software Engineering, Software Testing, and Software Development — especially creating practical solutions that make things simpler and more efficient.<br/>
I enjoy working in teams, sharing ideas, and learning from others. I’m curious, patient, and not afraid to refactor my code when I find a better approach.<br/>

- 🌍 I’m based in Bangkok, Thailand<br/>
- ✉️ You can contact me at **tutorship57@gmail.com**<br/>
- 👥 I’m looking to collaborate on Software Development, Software Testing, and Automated Testing
